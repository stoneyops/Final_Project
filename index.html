<h2>About</h2>
<p>My name is Nolan Stoney and I was born in Manchester, New Hampshire. I grew up playing baseball and soccer, and eventually stopped soccer and just played baseball. My favorite things are music and playing baseball and hope that one day I can make music as my job. I currently attend New England College and major in multi media and game design, as-well as play for the baseball team.
